# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Automate separation of high-value "signal" from low-value "noise" in daily journal entries, **focusing primarily on new ongoing entries**
- Create an agent-based content elevation pipeline for real-time processing of daily dictation entries
- Reduce manual curation time from hours to seconds while maintaining 90%+ accuracy
- Extract and track structured data (mood, activities) for trend analysis
- Build a trusted, autonomous system with human gatekeeper controls
- **Secondary goal**: Process existing 5,000+ note backlog (post-MVP)

## Background Context
The user maintains a prolific daily dictation journal practice (20-60 minutes daily) resulting in over 5,000 Obsidian notes. While therapeutically valuable, this creates a significant curation challenge where valuable insights become lost in mundane daily logs. Current manual hashtag and search methods don't scale, requiring an intelligent automated solution to transform the raw journal into a pristine, curated knowledge base.
