# Epic 3: Statistics Agent & Autonomous Processing

**Epic Goal:** Implement the high-autonomy Statistics Agent that extracts mood ratings and commits data directly to the database, proving autonomous agent capabilities.

## Story 3.1: Statistics Agent Core Implementation

As a system,
I want a Statistics Agent that can extract mood ratings from journal text,
so that structured emotional data can be captured automatically.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. StatisticsAgent implements base agent interface for framework integration
2. Agent uses Semantic Kernel to identify mood ratings in text (e.g., "mood: 4/5")
3. Agent extracts numerical mood values and associated context
4. Agent generates confidence scores for extracted mood data
5. Agent configuration supports pattern matching and extraction rules

## Story 3.2: Autonomous Database Commits

As a Statistics Agent,
I want to commit extracted mood data directly to the database,
so that high-confidence extractions bypass the review queue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Statistics Agent evaluates confidence scores against configured thresholds
2. High-confidence extractions (>95%) are committed directly to ExtractedData table
3. Low-confidence extractions create ElevationProposals for review
4. Database commits include source file path, extraction timestamp, and confidence score
5. Autonomous actions are logged for audit trail

## Story 3.3: Mood Data Validation & Error Handling

As a system,
I want robust validation and error handling for mood data extraction,
so that invalid or corrupt data doesn't compromise the database.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Mood values are validated within expected ranges (e.g., 1-5 scale)
2. Duplicate extractions from the same file are prevented or merged
3. Database constraint violations are handled gracefully
4. Failed extractions generate appropriate log entries
5. System continues processing other content when individual extractions fail

## Story 3.4: Statistics Agent Configuration & Testing

As an administrator,
I want configurable settings for the Statistics Agent,
so that extraction behavior can be tuned for accuracy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Agent configuration includes confidence thresholds for autonomous commits
2. Configuration supports custom mood rating patterns and scales
3. Agent can be enabled/disabled via configuration without code changes
4. Test files validate mood extraction accuracy across various text formats
5. Configuration changes take effect without service restart
