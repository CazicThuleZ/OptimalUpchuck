# Epic 1: Foundation & Clean Architecture Setup

**Epic Goal:** Establish foundational project infrastructure with clean architecture principles, database connectivity, and core Microsoft Semantic Kernel integration while delivering basic system health monitoring.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup & Clean Architecture Structure

As a developer,
I want a properly structured clean architecture project setup,
so that the codebase follows separation of concerns and supports scalable development.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Solution structure follows clean architecture with Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Presentation layers
2. Core project dependencies are configured (Entity Framework, Semantic Kernel, RabbitMQ client)
3. Docker compose file exists for PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ services
4. Basic configuration system supports YAML/JSON agent settings
5. Project builds successfully and runs basic health check endpoint

## Story 1.2: Database Schema & Entity Framework Setup

As a system,
I want a PostgreSQL database with proper schema for elevation proposals and extracted data,
so that I can store and retrieve curation workflow information.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Entity Framework migrations create tables for ElevationProposals, ExtractedData, and AgentConfigurations
2. ElevationProposal entity includes content, confidence score, agent rationale, and approval status
3. ExtractedData entity supports mood ratings and other structured data with timestamps
4. Database connection strings and Entity Framework context are properly configured
5. Migration can be applied successfully to PostgreSQL instance

## Story 1.3: Semantic Kernel Agent Framework

As a system,
I want a configurable agent framework using Microsoft Semantic Kernel,
so that I can load and execute specialized content analysis agents.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. AgentService can load agent configurations from YAML/JSON files
2. Base agent interface defines Execute method with input text and output proposal
3. Agent factory can instantiate agents based on configuration settings
4. Framework supports agent-specific settings including autonomy levels and confidence thresholds
5. Basic logging captures agent execution and results

## Story 1.4: System Health & Monitoring Endpoints

As an administrator,
I want basic health check and monitoring endpoints,
so that I can verify system components are operational.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Health check endpoint reports database connectivity status
2. Health check endpoint reports RabbitMQ connectivity status
3. Health check endpoint reports loaded agent configurations
4. Basic logging framework captures system startup and component initialization
5. Docker health checks are configured for all services
