- Domain layer MUST NOT reference Application, Infrastructure, or Presentation layers
- Application layer can reference Domain but NOT Infrastructure or Presentation
- Infrastructure layer can reference Domain and Application
- Presentation layer can reference Application and Domain (through Application)
- Use ArchUnit tests to enforce dependency rules if possible

### Configuration Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L24]
- Access configuration ONLY through IOptions pattern
- Never use IConfiguration directly in business logic
- Always bind to strongly-typed configuration classes
- Support both JSON and YAML configuration formats

### Database Connection Setup
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md#L4-L6]
- Enable UUID extension: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"`
- Use UUID primary keys with `uuid_generate_v4()` default
- Connection string configured in appsettings.json under `ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection`

### Docker Services Configuration
[Source: architecture/high-level-architecture.md#L11-L16]
- PostgreSQL service with persistent volume
- RabbitMQ service with management UI
- Health monitoring for all services
- Service orchestration for local development

### Coding Standards for Setup
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#L19-L39]
- **Service Registration:** All services MUST be registered in Program.cs with appropriate lifetimes
- **Dependency Injection:** Singleton for stateless services, Scoped for database contexts, Transient for lightweight operations
- **Async/Await:** ALL database and HTTP operations MUST use async/await with ConfigureAwait(false)
- **Nullable Reference Types:** Enable project-wide with `#nullable enable`
- **Record Types:** Use record types for DTOs and value objects requiring immutability

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#L10-L17]
- **Framework:** xUnit 2.6.1 with FluentAssertions for readable assertions
- **File Convention:** `{ClassName}Tests.cs` in parallel folder structure
- **Location:** `tests/{LayerName}.Tests/` matching source project structure
- **Mocking:** Moq 4.20.69 for interface mocking and behavior verification
- **Coverage:** 95% for Domain layer, 85% for Application layer
- **Test Infrastructure:** Testcontainers for PostgreSQL integration tests

## Testing

### Test File Locations
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#L14-L15]
- Unit tests: `tests/{LayerName}.Tests/` matching source project structure
- Integration tests: `tests/OptimalUpchuck.Integration.Tests/`
- Test projects should mirror source structure with `.Tests` suffix

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#L13-L16]
- **Primary Framework:** xUnit 2.6.1 for all test types
- **Assertions:** FluentAssertions for readable test assertions
- **Mocking:** Moq 4.20.69 for interface mocking and behavior verification
- **Test Pattern:** AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert) with clear test method naming

### Testing Standards for This Story
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#L19-L25]
- Generate tests for all public methods and configuration classes
- Cover edge cases including configuration validation scenarios
- Mock all external dependencies including database and message queue connections
- Test health check endpoints with both success and failure scenarios
- Verify clean architecture dependency constraints with ArchUnit tests
