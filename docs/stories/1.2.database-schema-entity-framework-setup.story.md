### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

- Constraints: ReviewedAt logic (NULL when Pending, NOT NULL otherwise), Processing time validation
- Views: PendingProposalsSummary, AgentProcessingStats for common queries
- Triggers: update_updated_at_column() for AgentConfigurations table
- Cleanup functions: cleanup_old_audit_logs(), cleanup_completed_queue_items()

**Seed Data:**

- BloggingAgent: ReviewRequired, 0.60 threshold, content criteria

### Tech Stack Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Runtime:** .NET 9.0 with C# 13 (upgraded from .NET 8.0 in story 1.1)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16.1
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core 9.0.8 (already installed)
- **Configuration:** Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration 9.0 with IOptions pattern
- **Validation:** FluentValidation 12.0.0 for entity validation

### File Locations and Structure

### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Entity Framework Context:** NEVER use DbContext directly in domain layer - access through repository interfaces in Application layer
- **Configuration Access:** Use IOptions pattern - never IConfiguration directly in business logic
- **Async/Await Pattern:** ALL database operations MUST use async/await with ConfigureAwait(false)
- **Nullable Reference Types:** Enable project-wide with `#nullable enable` and handle all nullable warnings
- **Record Types:** Use record types for DTOs and value objects requiring immutability
- **Service Registration:** Register DbContext as Scoped lifetime in Program.cs dependency injection
- **Database Transactions:** Multi-step operations MUST use explicit transactions through Unit of Work pattern

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Test Structure:**
- **Location:** `tests/OptimalUpchuck.Domain.Tests/` and `tests/OptimalUpchuck.Infrastructure.Tests/`

- **File Convention:** `{ClassName}Tests.cs` in parallel folder structure
- **Coverage:** 95% for Domain entities, 85% for Infrastructure configurations

**Entity Testing Requirements:**
- Test all entity property validations and constraints
- Test value object behavior and immutability
- Test domain events are properly raised
- Mock database context using in-memory provider for unit tests
- Test Entity Framework configurations with real PostgreSQL using Testcontainers

**Integration Testing:**
- **Database:** Testcontainers with PostgreSQL 16.1 for isolated testing
